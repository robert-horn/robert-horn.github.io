<a href="https://johnhcochrane.blogspot.com/2022/12/stanford-hates-fun.html">Institutional evil in Stanford university</a>
</p>

<p>
An overview of the ongoing process of total fun destruction at Stanford. In brief, the previous anything-goes, rule-breaking encouraged attitude the university was famous for has been replaced with neurotic terror of people being young. Parties must be pre-registered with a list of attendants; housing has had all identity and community destroyed through insidious schemes. Evil reigns.
This is horrifying and very bad and we should all be worried. You probably hate fun too (I certainly do, I'm afraid), because we as a generation have had our minds poisoned with neuroticism.

Hermaphroditic whales in the bible - a series of links
</p>

<p>
It is well known that in the book of Jonah in the OT, Jonah is swallowed by a
whale and spends three days &amp; nights in its belly. What you may not know is that
the whale is referred to first as a "dag" - "fish", then later as a "dag'ah" -
"female fish". What could be the explanation for this? Luckily, the rabbis are one step ahead of us. The Talmud offers a simple explanation. Jonah was swallowed by a big, male fish, yes. But then half-way through his incetacean period, he was sicked up and swallowed again by a second, different whale. Why the book does not make this clearer is a mystery, but it is the only reasonable explanation!

If your browser doesn't work, I'm trying to direct you to the section titled "jack0fnone". The rest of the page is interesting but not nearly as funny.
</p>

<p>
This is worth reading mainly because of the odd poetry of the blackmailer -

<b>The rightful ending here reads:</b><br>

<b>Cheers to something more and nothing less.</b>

<b>I most certainly am the guy you are looking for, and if not I am forever inclined to be the one you’re looking out for. I would strongly urge against vocalizing your concerns or findings any further in the various communities which you grace as a form of mitigating the future risks you assume to be impending.</b>

<h2 id="orgb00eb1c"><span class="section-number-2">2.</span> Three Good Films</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2">
<p>
Here are some films I have particularly liked in the past month (or so, in the case of this first post!)
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org4a8a253" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org4a8a253"><span class="section-number-3">2.1.</span> The Graduate (1967)</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-1">
<p>
This was probably my favourite film in a fair while. A promising university graduate/athlete is totally lost entering the post-university world. He passes his time by having an affair.
The Graduate is extremely funny, but in a fairly subtle way. Possibly my favourite thing about the film is the way it was shot - the camera work is stunningly beautiful. The soundtrack is controversial, but I think it works very well. The atmosphere the film creates, and the portrait it paints of the world it depicts is wonderful.
</p>

<p>
It was pointed out to me after I watched this that it is about American protestant society and how it destroys people's souls. The specific anti-protestant angle was not obvious to me when I watched it, but perhaps it will be to you.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-org5dad739" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org5dad739"><span class="section-number-3">2.2.</span> Inherent Vice (2014)</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-2">
<p>
Inherent Vice is a slow-burner. It is difficult to describe exactly how and why it is so good. The film has an excellent sense of humour, lovely atmosphere, and top-notch sharp writing. It is difficult to understand, and a little fever-dreamish. I recommend relaxing and simply enjoying the experience.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org8e42cd0" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org8e42cd0"><span class="section-number-3">2.3.</span> Theatre of Blood (1973)</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-3">
<p>
Of the three films I recommend this the most!
A Shakespearean actor takes revenge on critics. This film is extremely funny and shockingly well-acted for what it is. It has that lovely seventies weirdness that tragically dried up with the increasing costs associated with making films, and massively inflated salaries for actors.

<p>
<a href="https://blogs.cornell.edu/info2040/2014/11/12/doctors-dont-know-bayes-theorem/comment-page-1/">But here's a blog about it</a>.
</p>

<p>
<a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-28166019">And here's a highly entertaining article about the chap (Gigerenzer) who ran one of the original studies and his motivation for doing so.</a>
</p>

<p>
Here are three questions given to large numbers of doctors by various studies:
</p>

<p>
Q1: True or false: the p-value is the probability that the null hypothesis is correct
</p>

<p>
Q2: A 50-year-old woman, no symptoms, participates in routine mammography screening. She tests positive, is alarmed, and wants to know from you whether she has breast cancer for certain or what the chances are. Apart from the screening results, you know nothing else about this woman. How many women who test positive actually have breast cancer? What is the best answer?
</p>

<p>
nine in 10
</p>

<p>
eight in 10
</p>

<p>
one in 10
</p>

<p>
one in 100
</p>

<p>
Given:
</p>

<p>
The probability that a woman has breast cancer is 1% (“prevalence”)
</p>

<p>
If a woman has breast cancer, the probability that she tests positive is 90% (“sensitivity”)
</p>

<p>
If a woman does not have breast cancer, the probability that she nevertheless tests positive is 9% (“false alarm rate”)
</p>


<p>
Q3: Ten out of every 1,000 women have breast
cancer. Of these 10 women with breast cancer, 9 test
positive. Of the 990 women without cancer, about 89
nevertheless test positive. A woman tests positive and wants
to know whether she has breast cancer for sure, or at least
what the chances are.
</p>

<p>
What is the best answer?
</p>

<p>
(1) The probability that she has breast cancer is about 90%
</p>

<p>
(2) The probability that she has breast cancer is about 81%
</p>

<p>
(3) Out of 10 women with a positive mammogram, about 9 have breast cancer
</p>

<p>
(4) Out of 10 women with a positive mammogram, about 1 has breast cancer
</p>

<p>
(5) The probability that she has breast cancer is about 1%.
</p>

<p>
Two of those, you will note, are very similar, although one is made so clear it would be extremely embarassing to get it wrong. Nonetheless, the increased clarity produced very modest improvements in doctors' understanding.
</p>

<p>
Q1 was correctly answered as FALSE by only 42% of doctors! Worse than tossing a coin.
</p>

<p>
Q2 was correctly answered by 21% of doctors out of the four options. Worse than tossing an appropriate 4-sided coin.
</p>

<p>
Q3 was correctly answered by 26% of doctors! This was achieved by spoon-feeding the answer in a rather extreme manner, such that the doctors only actually need the ability to tell whether a number is bigger or smaller than another. Doctors then actually beat a five-sided coin. Well done doctors! I trust you to prescribe me anything you like.
</p>

</p>

<p>
Only 42% of Doctors correctly answered "True or false: the p-value is the probability that the null hypothesis is correct” as FALSE!
</p>

<p>
In summary he says, yes they're wrong, but: "The question seems sketchy to me. It is indeed technically false, but it seems pretty close to the truth. If I were asked to explain why the definition as given was false, the best I could do is say that your probability of the null hypothesis being true should take into account both something like your p-value, and your prior. But since no one ever receives Bayesian statistical education, I am not sure it is fair to expect a doctor to be able to generate that objection."
</p>

<p>
This is, the eagle-eyed among you will have noticed, entirely wrong!. The probability of observing something (or more) given the null hypothesis is easily calculated and a helpful thing to have handy. The probability of the null hypothesis being true given your data is 1. Entirely different and 2. Generally impossible to calculate. and 3. More or less nonsensical in your standard frequentist framework!
</p>

<p>
In short: P([Observation or more extreme]|H<sub>0</sub>) is not the same as P(H<sub>0</sub>|Observation)! You really, really don't need Bayesian stats to understand that idea. They are entirely different. Do not fall for Mr. Codex's doctory tricks.

As the world's biggest Scott Alexander fan, this brings me great displeasure.
